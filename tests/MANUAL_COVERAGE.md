# Manual-Only Coverage Gaps

Commands that cannot be covered by automated tests due to side effects,
account requirements, or external dependencies.

## Irreversible Operations

- **ads moderate** — submits ads for moderation; cannot be undone. A
  smoke-test would leave real ads in a moderation queue.
- **campaigns/ads suspend/resume/archive/unarchive on ACCEPTED
  objects** — changes live traffic. Live-write tests only exercise these
  on DRAFT-state objects (Sandbox Limitation category A).

## Account-Scoped Operations

- **agencyclients add/update/delete** — requires an agency-type account.
  Non-agency accounts receive 403. The current sandbox agency account can
  read agency clients, but creation returns error 3001: "No rights to create
  clients".
- **agencyclients add-passport-organization** — creates a real Passport
  organization linked to the account. The current sandbox agency account is
  sandbox-limited for this operation with error 3001.
- **agencyclients add-passport-organization-member** — sends an invitation
  email to an external user.

## Financial Operations

- **bids set** / **keywordbids set** / **bidmodifiers set** on existing
  non-draft objects — spends real budget. Live-write tests only verify
  request assembly via `--dry-run`.
- **v4finance create/pay/transfer operations** — `CreateInvoice`,
  `PayCampaigns`, and `TransferMoney` are financial side-effect operations.
  `TransferMoney` and `PayCampaigns` remain dry-run-only in the public CLI.
  `CreateInvoice` is exposed with typed `--payment CAMPAIGN_ID=AMOUNT` flags
  and is live-capable when `--dry-run` is omitted. The live write test is
  guarded by `YANDEX_DIRECT_LIVE_FINANCE_WRITE=1`,
  `YANDEX_DIRECT_TEST_CAMPAIGN_ID`, financial credentials, and
  `YANDEX_DIRECT_OPERATION_NUM`; without financial credentials sandbox returns
  `error_code=350 Invalid financial transaction token`.
- **v4finance check-payment** — read-only. Official public docs were not found;
  sandbox v4 Live confirms `CustomTransactionID` (32 latin alphanumeric
  characters), not `PaymentID`. A dummy valid transaction ID returns
  `error_code=370 Transaction does not exist`, which is accepted as request
  shape proof.

## Campaign-Type Restrictions (Category B)

Some campaign types are only available on agency or pilot accounts.
Live tests skip gracefully when the API returns error 3500. The full
lifecycle on such an account is **not yet recorded** — tracked in issue #538.

- **DYNAMIC_TEXT_CAMPAIGN** — `dynamicads` add/update/delete/suspend/resume
  require an account where DYNAMIC_TEXT_CAMPAIGN is enabled. Standard
  advertiser accounts receive 3500.
- **SMART_CAMPAIGN** — `smartadtargets` add/update/delete/suspend/resume
  require SMART_CAMPAIGN support. Standard accounts receive 3500.

## Audience Target Restrictions (Category A)

- **audiencetargets add/delete and suspend/resume** — need a `RETARGETING`
  list, which references a Metrica goal id. The tests resolve a real goal via
  `YANDEX_DIRECT_TEST_RETARGETING_GOAL_ID` (see Phase 6 below) and record the
  full lifecycle; with no real goal the synthetic `12345` fallback makes the
  API return 8800 (Object not found) and the test skips gracefully.

## Ad Image Restrictions (Category A)

- **adimages add** — some accounts reject PNG uploads with error 5004
  (Invalid image file type). Live tests skip gracefully on 5004. The full
  lifecycle on an image-upload-enabled account is **not yet recorded** —
  tracked in issue #538.

## External Dependencies

- **advideos add** — requires a valid, publicly accessible video URL. The
  Yandex API rejects placeholder URLs (e.g. `example.com`). A real video
  must be hosted externally; this cannot be automated. No cleanup possible
  via CLI — `advideos` has no `delete` subcommand.
- **creatives add** — depends on a valid `video_id` from `advideos add`,
  so it inherits the same limitation.

## Sandbox-Unreachable, Covered Live (Phase 6)

These mutating commands cannot run in the sandbox (it returns 8800/6000) but
are exercised against the live draft API in `test_v5_live_write.py`. Notes
captured while recording the cassettes — re-recording must honour them:

- **feeds add/update/delete** — sandbox rejects `feeds update` (8800); live
  records the full lifecycle. Standard URL feed, no external dependency, fully
  reversible (delete removes the feed).
- **retargeting add/update/delete** — a `RETARGETING` rule argument needs a
  Metrica goal id **_and_ a MembershipLifeSpan** (`--rule ALL:<goal>:<days>`);
  a bare `ALL:<goal>` is rejected with error 5000 ("Not specified time for goal
  or segment"). The goal id is resolved by `_retargeting_goal()` from
  `YANDEX_DIRECT_TEST_RETARGETING_GOAL_ID` (a real account goal — discover one
  with `python3 -m direct_cli._smoke_probes retargeting-goal`). With the env var
  set, the full lifecycle records; with it unset, the synthetic `12345` fallback
  (the same convention as the audiencetargets smoke tests) makes the live API
  return 8800 ("Object not found") and the test skips, recording the request
  shape rather than a passing lifecycle.
  **A real goal id is never committed:** the `tests/conftest.py` VCR filter
  (`_mask_retargeting_goal`) rewrites it to `12345` in both request and response
  bodies before the cassette is written, so recorded cassettes always show
  `12345`. The repository is public — never hardcode a real account goal id.
- **strategies add/update/archive/unarchive** — a shared strategy must be made
  public, which requires a shared-account wallet; accounts without one are
  rejected with error 6000 and the test skips. **The Yandex Direct API has no
  `Strategies.delete` operation** (the service exposes only add/update/get/
  archive/unarchive), so a strategy created by the test cannot be removed via
  the API — cleanup archives it (`StatusArchived=YES`, non-serving). On an
  account with a wallet the test leaves one archived strategy behind; this is
  an API limitation, not a test defect.
